# Need to invest and investments

In a nutshell, investment is important inorder to shield ourselves from inflation and generate wealth.

We can invest in any of the following asset classes :
1. Fixed income instruments
> These are investable instruments with very limited risk to the principle and the return is paid as an interest to the investor based on the particular fixed-income instrument.At the end of the term of deposit, (also known as maturity period) the capital is returned to the investor. Bonds and Fixed Deposits are Fixed income instruments. Interest varies around 8% to 11%.

2. Equity
> Investment in Equities involves buying shares of publicly listed companies. The shares are traded both on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), and the National Stock Exchange (NSE). There is no capital guarantee here. The returns are higher and tax is also low.

3. Real estate
> Real Estate Investment involves transacting (buying and selling) commercial and non-commercial land. Typical examples would include transacting in sites, apartments and commercial buildings. There are two sources of income from real estate investments namely – Rental income, and Capital appreciation of the investment amount.

> The transaction procedure can be quite complex involving legal verification of documents. The cash outlay in real estate investment is usually quite large.

4. Commodities (precious metals)
> Investments in gold and silver are considered one of the most popular investment avenues. Gold and silver over a long-term period have appreciated in value. Investments in these metals have yielded a CAGR return of approximately 8% over the last 20 years. There are several ways to invest in gold and silver. One can choose to invest in the form of jewelry or Exchange Traded Funds (ETF).  

Investments optimally should have a strong mix of all asset classes. It is smart to diversify your investment among the various asset classes. The technique of allocating money across assets classes is termed as ‘Asset Allocation’.

+ Higher the risk, higher the return. Lower the risk, lower is the return.
+ Principal amount is protected in fixed income investments and is relatively less risky. However, you have the risk of losing money when you adjust the return for inflation.
+ Investment in Equities is known to beat inflation and has generated returns close to 14-15% in the past. However, equity investments can be risky
+ Real Estate investment requires a large outlay of cash and cannot be done with smaller amounts. *Liquidity* is another issue with real estate investment – you cannot buy or sell whenever you want. You always have to wait for the right time and the right buyer or seller to transact with you.
+ Gold and silver are known to be a relatively safer but the historical return on such investment has not been very encouraging.

# Stock Market Introduction

## Stock markets and Regulators
The stock market is where everyone who wants to transact in shares goes to. The main purpose of the stock market is to help you facilitate your transactions. You can access the stock market via a registered intermediary called the stockbroker.  

There are two main stock exchanges in India that make up the stock markets. They are the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Besides these two exchanges, there are a bunch of other regional stock exchanges which don’t play any meaningful role anymore.  

When money is involved, human emotions in the form of greed and fear run high. One can easily fall prey to these emotions and get involved in unfair practices. Given this, the stock markets need someone who can set the rules of the game (commonly referred to as regulation and compliance) and ensure that people adhere to these regulations and compliance thereby making the markets a level playing field for everyone.

In India the stock market regulator is called The Securities and Exchange Board of India often referred to as SEBI. The objective of SEBI is to promote the development of stock exchanges, protect the interest of retail investors, regulate the activities of market participants and financial intermediaries.

Points to note -
+ When you buy shares these shares sit in your Depositary account usually referred to as the DEMAT account.
+ When companies want to raise a loan they can issue debenture against which they promise to pay an interest. These debentures can be subscribed by public. Debentures give the company a way to get funds without diluting its equity. Interest to be paid on debentures is a charge against profit for the company. They also tend to be cheaper. Debenture holders bear very little risk since the loan is secured and the interest is payable even in the case of a loss to the company.
+ If a company plans to raise money by floating an IPO, then merchant bankers are the ones who help companies with the IPO process.

## Financial Intermediaries

**Stock Broker** is the gateway to stock exchanges. One needs to open a ‘Trading Account’ with a broker.

When you buy a share (a share represents part ownership in a company) the only way to claim your ownership is by producing your share certificate. A share certificate is nothing but a piece of document entitling you as the owner of the shares in a company. The storage place for the digital share certificate is the ‘DEMAT Account’. A **Depository** offers the service of the Demat account.

**Banks** help in facilitating the fund transfer from your bank account to your trading account.

**NSCCL – National Security Clearing Corporation Ltd and Indian Clearing Corporation** ensure guaranteed settlement of your trades/transactions. The clearing corporation also ensures there are no defaults by either party. For instance the seller after selling the shares should not be in a position to back out thereby defaulting in his transaction.

# Stages of a Business
+ Investors who place their trust in the entrepreneur and invest in pre-revenue stage are known as **Angel investors**. This initial investment used to start the business is called as 'The Seed Fund'.
+ The money is placed in the company's bank account and is referred as the inital **share capital** of the company. The investors and entrepreneurs are issued with share certificates which entitles them as the owners of the company.
+ **Face value** is the value of each share and it depends on the **valuation** of company and no. of shares.
+ Face value is the value of share on which company calculates & pay dividend & other benefits to the shareholders. **Issue price** is the price at which shares has been issued in secondary market.
+ **Authorised shares** refer to the maximum number of shares that a corporation is legally permitted to issue.
+ The alloted portion of shares is called as **issued shares**. The shares which are *authorised* but *not alloted* remain with the company.
+ The investor who invests in an early stage of business is called '**Venture Capitalist (VC)**' and the money that the business gets at this stage is called **Series A funding**.
+ Suppose the valuation of the company is 5cr. If a VC agrees to invest 7cr for 14% stake at the company, then the VC estimates the company's valuation to be 50cr.
+  Whenever a company plans such expenditure to improve the overall business, the expenditure is called **'Capital Expenditure’** or simply ‘CAPEX’. It can fund the CAPEX requirements through,
    + Profits, called as funding through **internal accruals**
    + Another round of VC funding by allotting shares from the authorized capital – this is called **Series B funding**
    + a loan is also called **‘Debt’** from a bank
+ Raising money through debt has interest rate burden, also called the finance charges which would eat away the profits the company generates.
+ VC funding is usually small and runs into a few crores.**Private Equity(PE)** investors invest large amounts of money with the objective of not only providing the capital for constructive use but also place their own people on the board of the investee company to ensure the company steers in the required direction.
+ When a company files for an IPO, they have to offer their shares to the general public. The general public will subscribe to the shares (if they want to) by paying a certain price. If the company is offering the shares for the first time to the public, it is called the “Initial Public Offer’.

# IPO Markets

## Why does a company go public?
- Fund required for CAPEX is raised.
- All share holders share the same amount of risk. Through public offering, the risk is spread among a large number of people.
- The existing shareholders can sell their shares to the public and exit the company.
- Shares can be allotted to employees as an incentive.
- Trading publicly increases the visibility of the company, thereby impacting in positive growth.
- There is no interest repayment like in debt and company can raise large funds.

## Merchant Bankers and the process of becoming public
> Merchant bankers are also called Book Running Lead Managers (BRLM)/Lead Manager (LM). The job of a merchant banker is to assist the company with various aspects of the IPO process including:
+ Conduct due diligence on the company filing for an IPO, ensure their legal compliance and also issue a due diligence certificate
+ Should work closely with the company and prepare their listing documents including Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) - This is an pre-eliminary registration document or prospectus. 
A DRHP should contain the following details:  
  
    - The estimated size of the IPO
    - The estimated number of shares being offered to the public
    - Why the company wants to go public and how does the company plan to utilize the funds along with the timeline projection of fund utilization
    - Business description including the revenue model, expenditure details
    - Complete financial statements
    - Management Discussion and Analysis – how the company perceives future business operations to emerge
    - Risks involved in the business
    - Management details and their background
+ Underwrite shares – By underwriting shares, merchant bankers essentially agree to buy all or part of the IPO shares and resell the same to the public
+ Help the company arrive at the price band for the IPO. A price band is the lower and upper limit of the share price within which the company will go public. The price band is usually higher than the actual than the actual value of shares.
+ Help the company with promotional/marketing activity for the company’s IPO
+ Appointment of other intermediaries namely, registrars, bankers, advertising agencies, etc. The Lead manager also makes various marketing strategies for the issue

During the bidding process (also called the date of issue) investors can bid for shares at a particular price within the specified price band.  This whole system around the date of the issue where one bids for shares, is referred to as the Primary Market. The moment the stock gets listed and debuts on the stock exchange, the stock starts to trade publicly. This is called the secondary market.  

Once the stock transitions from primary markets to secondary markets, the stock gets traded daily on the stock exchange. People start buying and selling stocks regularly.

# Options Trading

## Moneyness of an Option :
> Moneyness of an option is a classification method which classifies each option strike based on how much money a trader is
likely to make if he were to exercise his option contract today.  
There are 3 broad classifications –
1. In the Money (ITM)
2. At the Money (ATM)
3. Out of the Money (OTM)

If the intrinsic value is a non zero number, then the
option strike is considered ‘In the money’. If the intrinsic value is a zero the option
strike is called ‘Out of the money’. The strike which is closest to the Spot price is
called ‘At the money’.  In general, ITM
options are always more expensive compared to OTM options.  

## Volatility :
>It is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. Volatility can either be measured by using the standard deviation or variance between returns from that same security or market index. Commonly higher the standard deviation, higher is the risk.

> ### Random Walk :   
> ![Random Walk Simulation](https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-C17-GaltonBoard2.png)
    
> ![Standard Deviation in Gaussian](https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-C17-ND-graph1.png)

The daily returns of a stock or an index cannot be predicted.However if I collect the daily returns of the stock for a certain period and see the distribution of these returns – I get to see a normal(Gaussian) distribution.


## Option Greeks :
> The premium of the option depends on certain forces called as the ‘OptionGreeks’. Crudely put, some Option Greeks tends to increase the premium, whilesome try to reduce the premium. Though all these factors work as independent agents, yet they are all intervened with one another. A formula called the ‘Black & Scholes Option Pricing Formula’ employs these forces and translates the forces into a number, which is the premium of the option.  

These are the Option Greeks:  
1. Delta – Measures the rate of change of options premium based on the directional
movement of the underlying
2. Gamma – Rate of change of delta itself
3. Vega – Rate of change of premium based on change in volatility
4. Theta – Measures the impact on premium based on time left for expiry

### Delta of an Option:
> The Delta measures how an options value changes with respect to the change in the underlying. *i.e;* Delta is the rate of change of *Premium* with respect to *Underlying*.  
The delta is a number which varies –
1. Between 0 and 1 for a call option, some traders prefer to use the 0 to 100 scale. So
the delta value of 0.55 on 0 to 1 scale is equivalent to 55 on the 0 to 100 scale.  
2. Between -1 and 0 (-100 to 0) for a put option. So the delta value of -0.4 on the -1 to 0
scale is equivalent to -40 on the -100 to 0 scale.  

**Note-** 
- The delta value cannot be greater than 1. If that is the case, the change in value of premium will be more than that of underlying stock which is codswallop. Option is derived from its underlying and it can never move faster than the underlying itself.
- The delta value cannot be less than 0 as there is a chance that premium becomes negative because of negative delta.

The delta changes with changes in the value of spot. Hence delta is a variable and not really a fixed entity. Therefore if an option has a delta of 0.4, the value is likely to change with the change in the value of the underlying. It's relation can represented through the following graph :-   
![Delta vs Moneyness](https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Image-1_Delta-vs-Spot1.png)

Note the following points about the above graph (written with respect to call option but similar observations can be made for put option) -
- The delta value increases as spot value increases
- Delta doesn't change much when monyness is deep OTM or OTM ( similarily with deep ITM and ITM).
- Delta hits 0.5 at ATM.

We can conclude the following (written for call options)-
- Deep OTM options tends to put on an impressive percentage however for this to happen the spot has to move by a large value.
> The change in premium is proportional to change in underlying (by a factor of delta). The premiums are low for OTM options hence a meaningful change in underlying can give massive yields of premium in terms of percentages.
- The slightly OTM option which usually has a delta value of say 0.2 or 0.3 is more sensitive to changes in the underlying. For any meaningful change in the underlying the percentage change in the slightly OTM options is very impressive.
> The delta is higher than deep OTM options hence less risk and more returns. The risk is lower because if the spot price decreases the delta value remains almost same (curve is flatter and change is low) and the returns are more because if spot price increases the delta value increases rapidly (acceleration stage). In a vague manner, we are talking about f"(x) and not f'(x). *We can say that the premium vs spot price curve looks like an exponential curve here.* Note that the premiums are higher in case of OTM options when compared to deep OTM ones.
- ATM options are more sensitive to changes in the spot when compared to OTM options. Now because the ATM’s delta is high the underlying need not really move by a large value. Even if the underlying moves by a small value the option premium changes. However buying ATM options are more expensive when compared to OTM options.
> The percentage yields are lower because the premium also increased rapidly when compared to OTM options.
- In terms of the absolute change in the number of points, the deep ITM option scores over the slightly ITM option. However in terms of percentage change it is the other way round. Clearly ITM options are more sensitive to the changes in the underlying but certainly most expensive.
> The risk is lowest in ITM options. When delta is 1 (deep ITM), buying a deep ITM option is as good as buying the underlying itself. This is because whatever is the change in the underlying, the deep ITM option will experience the same change. Deep ITM option moves in line with the underlying, this means you can substitute a deep ITM option to a futures contract (lesser margin though).

The above can be summarised as follows - 
The price is 2210 and the expectation is a 30 point change in the underlying (which means we are expecting spot price to hit
2240). We will also assume there is plenty of time to expiry; hence time is not really a concern.  
| Moneyness | Strike | Delta | Old Premium | Change in Premium | New Premium | % Change |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Deep OTM  |  2400  | 0.05  |   Rs.3/-    |   30* 0.05 = 1.5  | 3+1.5 = 4.5 |   50%    |
|Slightly OTM| 2275| 0.3| Rs.7/-| 30*0.3 = 9| 7 +9 = 16| 129%|
|ATM| 2210| 0.5| Rs.12/-| 30*0.5 = 15| 12+15 = 27| 125%|
|Slightly ITM| 2200| 0.7| Rs.22/-| 30*0.7 = 21| 22+21 = 43| 95.45%|
|Deep ITM| 2150| 1| Rs.75/-| 30*1 = 30| 75 + 30 =105| 40%|

- Deltas of the call and puts can be added as long as it belongs to the same underlying.
- Positions such as this – which have a combined delta of 0 are also called ‘Delta
Neutral’ positions. Delta Neutral positions do not get impacted by any directional change. They behave as if they are insulated to the market movements.However, Delta neutral positions react to other variables like Volatility and Time. 
- This technique of adding up the deltas is very helpful when you have multiple option positions running simultaneously and you want to identify the overall directional impact on the positions.
- Futures contract is only affected by the direction of the market, however the options contracts are affected by many other variables besides the direction of the markets.
- Delta also *represents* the probability of the moneyness to change to favourable conditions. As in, if the delta of an OTM option is 0.3, then the probability that this Option turns into an ITM before expiry is 30%.

### Gamma of an Option :
> If *delta* is considered as velocity then *gamma* is acceleration. *Premium* can be considered as distance. Gamma is also referred to as **the curvature of option**. The gamma is usually expressed in deltas gained or lost per one point change in the underlying – with the delta increasing by the amount of the gamma when the underlying rises and falling by the amount of the gamma when the underlying falls.
- The change in Gamma due to changes in underlying is captured by 3rd derivative of underlying called “Speed” or “Gamma of Gamma” or “DgammaDspot”. For all practical purposes, it is not necessary to get into the discussion of Speed.

### Theta of an Option :
`Premium = Time value + Intrinsic Value`
> All other things being equal, an option is a depreciating asset. The option’s premium erodes daily and this is attributable to the passage of time. approaches. The Theta or time decay factor is the rate at which an option loses value as time passes. Theta is expressed in points lost per day when all other conditions remain the same.  

Theta is a friendly Greek to the option seller. Remember the objective of the option seller is to retain the premium. Given that options lose value on a daily basis, the option seller can benefit by retaining the premium to the extent it loses value owing to time.  
![Premium vs Time](https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-5_Time-Decay.png)

### Vega of an Option :
>The Vega of an option measures the rate of change of option’s value (premium) with every percentage change in volatility. With increase in volatility, the Vega of an option increases (irrespective of calls and puts), and with increase in Vega, the option premium tends to increase. The effect of Vega is particularly high for ‘Out of the money’ options.
