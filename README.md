## Moneyness of an Option :
> Moneyness of an option is a classification method which classifies each option strike based on how much money a trader is
likely to make if he were to exercise his option contract today.  
There are 3 broad classifications –
1. In the Money (ITM)
2. At the Money (ATM)
3. Out of the Money (OTM)

If the intrinsic value is a non zero number, then the
option strike is considered ‘In the money’. If the intrinsic value is a zero the option
strike is called ‘Out of the money’. The strike which is closest to the Spot price is
called ‘At the money’.  In general, ITM
options are always more expensive compared to OTM options.  

## Option Greeks :
> The premium of the option depends on certain forces called as the ‘OptionGreeks’. Crudely put, some Option Greeks tends to increase the premium, whilesome try to reduce the premium. Though all these factors work as independent agents, yet they are all intervened with one another. A formula called the ‘Black & Scholes Option Pricing Formula’ employs these forces and translates the forces into a number, which is the premium of the option.  

These are the Option Greeks:  
1. Delta – Measures the rate of change of options premium based on the directional
movement of the underlying
2. Gamma – Rate of change of delta itself
3. Vega – Rate of change of premium based on change in volatility
4. Theta – Measures the impact on premium based on time left for expiry

### Delta of an Option:
> The Delta measures how an options value changes with respect to the change in the underlying. *i.e;* Delta is the rate of change of *Premium* with respect to *Underlying*.  
The delta is a number which varies –
1. Between 0 and 1 for a call option, some traders prefer to use the 0 to 100 scale. So
the delta value of 0.55 on 0 to 1 scale is equivalent to 55 on the 0 to 100 scale.  
2. Between -1 and 0 (-100 to 0) for a put option. So the delta value of -0.4 on the -1 to 0
scale is equivalent to -40 on the -100 to 0 scale.  

**Note-** 
- The delta value cannot be greater than 1. If that is the case, the change in value of premium will be more than that of underlying stock which is codswallop. Option is derived from its underlying and it can never move faster than the underlying itself.
- The delta value cannot be less than 0 as there is a chance that premium becomes negative because of negative delta.
